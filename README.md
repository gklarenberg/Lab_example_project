## Example project

#### Ordway Swisher Biological Station phenology data

*Geraldine Klarenberg, UF, Fall semester*

This is an example project to demonstrate how to set up the semester project.

All the required folders are inside the phenology folder. The project uses data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, and specifically the Ordway Swisher Biological Station (OSBS) data.

The "03_Analysis" folder explains what analysis was done, and which data was used. 

The "06_Documents" folder has manuals about data collection (done by NEON).

A metadata folder still needs to be added. Will be added in the Fall of 2025.
